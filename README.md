# Crocosphaera Fe/P (Co)-limitation

This respository includes the data and code to recreate analyses and figures from "	Diel molecular mechanisms underlying iron and phosphorus co-limitation responses in the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Crocosphaera".

## Abstract

In the nitrogen-limited subtropical gyres, diazotrophic cyanobacteria, including Crocosphaera, provide an essential ecosystem service by converting dinitrogen (N2)gas into ammonia to support primary production in these oligotrophic regimes. Natural gradients of phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) availability in the low-latitude oceans constrain the biogeography and activity of diazotrophs with important implications for marine biogeochemical cycling. Much remains unknown regarding Crocosphaeraâ€™s physiological response to multiple nutrient limitations and the underlying molecular drivers. We cultured C. watsonii under Fe, P, and Fe/P (co)-limiting scenarios to link cellular physiology with diel gene expression and observed unique physiological and transcriptional profiles for each nutrient-limited treatment. Counterintuitively, reduced growth and N2-fixation resource use efficiencies (RUEs) for Fe or P under P-limitation were alleviated under Fe/P co-limitation, which integrated the physiological and molecular responses observed in single nutrient-limited treatments. Functional enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes suggest that Fe-limitation increases cell wall flexibility and protein turnover, which work in concert with reduced cell size and P-limited upregulation of environmental sense-and-respond systems to enhance growth and RUEs in Fe/P co-limited cells. These findings are important to our understanding of nutrient controls on N2-fixation and the implications for primary productivity and microbial dynamics in a changing ocean.
